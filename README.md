In this project we show how to use azure and Machine Learning tools to predict diabetes!!
•The Core idea of my project is to solve medical science problems using today modern technology and A.I.
•Here I'm using machine learning to predict diabetes based on Eight parameters, I have trained and validated my model from kaggle dataset.
•We know diabetes is now most common disease, and 415 million people are now suffering from diabetes which is expected to increase by half-billion in 2040, so we need cutting edge technology to tackle such things, also I'm deeply interested to increase use of A.I in medical science field, it will useful and give better and fast results.
Problem Statement/Opportunity: We know Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves, so we need to focus today A.I to tackle such things, so here I have used machines learning to predict the symptoms of diabetes based on eight parameters.
